# Simulate Comorbidities

# Set up
population <- rep(0, 100)
prevalences <- list(malaria = .3, hiv = .2)
disability_weights <- list(malaria = .2, hiv = .4)

# Write a function to simulate comorbid ylds

  # Simulate a set of cases and YLDs for each disease


  # Compute unadjusted, adjusted YLDs: then return a list containing both values


# Pass your `population` variable to your function


# To show the variation in results, run your function 1000 times
# and keep track of the unadjusted and adjusted values

# Graph variation in results (histogram of all_unadjusted)

# Save your plot into a folder `charts/`

# Create a histogram of the ratio of the adjusted to unadjusted values

# Save your plot into a folder `charts/`
